Porting and extension of [pyDrude](https://github.com/Bellomia/pyDrude), the python project related to my master-thesis project. It has lead to a [publication](https://journals.aps.org/prb/accepted/92076Oa2H3a11a4af1b66a5040eb215b6f2ca66fb) in a top-tier condensed matter physics journal. I'll add soon more details about all of that.

# MATLAB version
The present version of the code has been mainly developed on R2019a. Now is being upgraded to R2020b.
